This is a Drupal Theme for the Software Systems Student Society.

It uses Twitter's Bootstrap to help out with the design.

The styling in this theme is written in LESS, and Stylus. The LESS part came with Bootstrap. The Stylus ones were added for additional styling.

## Developing

Be sure that you have Node.js, Ruby, and Ruby's Gem package manager installed.

If you installed those packages for the first time, then you might want to run the following command.

    ./configure

And it should install all necessary dependencies.
